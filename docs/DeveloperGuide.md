## Product scope
### Target user profile

Razputin is a busy house-husband. He wants to stay healthy, by cooking healthy food at home. He often forgets what food he stores in his fridge, especially because Mary, his wife, and John, his son, keep taking ingredients out of the fridge without informing him. He is often quite busy, and lacks the time to write out a proper ledger to take note of what is in the fridge.
Additionally, he needs to keep searching through his fridge every time he wants to cook something, just to check if all his ingredients are where he left them. A completely overfilling fridge, full of expired items, makes it difficult for him to know what exactly in the fridge is usable without doing a thorough inventory every single time he wants to cook.
Razputin recently put a revolver to his head, hoping to blow his brains out. However, his tech-savvy mind is always on the lookout for a new solution to his problems, one that can give him a will to live.

### Value proposition

{Describe the value proposition: what problem does it solve?}
Fridget helps Razputin automatically remind him of what is in his fridge. It provides a thorough inventory of all the items inside, alongside information like expiry date and estimated calories of common items. It does not automatically delete used items. It only works as well as Razputin and his family updates the ledger when items are inserted or removed.
It helps to compare recipes provided by Razputin and inform him what ingredients are lacking. As a preventative measure, it also reminds him to buy certain groceries which are in need of replenishment (milk, butter etc.). It can only compare recipes which Razputin has provided before.
