<h3 id="adding-items-into-fridget">Adding Items Into Fridget</h3>

<h4 id="main-objectives">Main Objectives:</h4>

<p>The functionality to add items is bound by two main objectives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make adding items convenient for the user</li>
  <li>Parse enough information about the ingredient to benefit the user in the future</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, the current iteration requires two pieces of info from the user:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The name of the ingredient</li>
  <li>The expiry date of the ingredient</li>
</ul>

<p>This is done to minimize the input required from the user per entry, while maximising future uses with the data.</p>

<p>Future uses include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finding if an ingredient exists by searching for its name</li>
  <li>Combining ingredients with similar names and expiry together</li>
  <li>Sort all ingredients by expiry date</li>
  <li>Remind users of expiring ingredients by name</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="overall-sequence">Overall Sequence:</h4>

<p><img src="/umlDiagrams/AddSequence.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>Step 1:</p>

<p>This step is almost always initiated by Fridget, but could potentially be done by another class in the future.</p>

<p>Step 2 &amp; 3:</p>

<p>The parseIngredientForAdding() method is called in Parser, with the currentUserInput as a parameter.
The parser returns an Ingredient with the name and expiry date specified in the user input.</p>

<p>Step 4:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>If the user uses the ‘</td>
      <td>’ character in the ingredient’s name, an exception is thrown.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>This is done as the ‘</td>
      <td>’ may confuse the Storage class.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Step 5 &amp; 6:</p>

<p>The Ingredient is added to IngredientList.
IngredientList returns a value signifying the current quantity of Ingredient in IngredientList.</p>

<p>Step 7 &amp; 8:</p>

<p>If the Ingredient already exists in Fridget’s IngredientList, print a message with the Ui to signify that the quantity of the existing item has increased to the user.</p>

<p>Step 9 &amp; 10:</p>

<p>If the ingredient does not exist, print a message using Ui to signify to the user that a new Ingredient has been added into Fridget.</p>

<p>Step 11:</p>

<p>The execution of the execute() method ends.</p>

<h3 id="removing-items-from-fridget">Removing Items From Fridget</h3>

<h3 id="getting-help-manual">Getting Help Manual</h3>

<h4 id="main-objectives-1">Main Objectives:</h4>

<p>The objective of a help manual in Fridget is to ensure users are equipped with the basic knowledge to get 
started with Fridget.</p>

<p>The idea behind an inbuilt help manual is to ensure Fridget is convenient and reduce the heavy reference of 
the User Guide.</p>

<p>Future uses include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>More in-depth coverage of all basic functions.</li>
  <li>Interactive component to explore capabilities of each commands.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="sequence-of-execution">Sequence of execution:</h4>

<p><img src="/umlDiagrams/HelpSequence.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>Step 1:</p>

<p>The execution of the Help Command is initiated by Fridget.</p>

<p>Step 2 &amp; 3:</p>

<p>The printLine() method is called in the Ui which prints out the String that is input into the method, 
in this case it is the help manual.</p>

<p>Step 4:</p>

<p>The execution of the execute() method ends.</p>

<h3 id="resetting-item-list-in-fridget">Resetting Item List In Fridget</h3>

<h4 id="main-objectives-2">Main Objectives:</h4>

<p>The objective of the reset functionality is to provide users an easy way to remove all the items in Fridget.</p>

<h4 id="overall-sequence-1">Overall Sequence:</h4>

<p><img src="/umlDiagrams/ResetSequence.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>Step 1:</p>

<p>The execution of this step is initiated by Fridget.</p>

<p>Step 2 &amp; 3:</p>

<p>If the user double confirms the reset command, the resetList() method is called in the IngredientList and resets 
the ingredient list by overwriting it with a new ingredient list.</p>

<p>Step 4 &amp; 5:</p>

<p>The printResetMessage() method is called in the Ui which prints a String stating that the ingredient list has been reset.</p>

<p>Step 6:</p>

<p>The execution of the execute() method ends.</p>

<h3 id="listing-items-in-fridget">Listing Items In Fridget</h3>

<h4 id="main-objectives-3">Main Objectives:</h4>

<p>The functionality to list items is bound by two main objectives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Allow users to easily view the contents of Fidget.</li>
  <li>Allow users to choose their preferred sort type.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, the current iteration optionally requires an additional info from the user:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The sort type of the list.</li>
</ul>

<p>This additional is optional as the default settings sorts the list by ingredient name.</p>

<h4 id="overall-sequence-2">Overall Sequence:</h4>

<p><img src="/umlDiagrams/ListSequence.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>Step 1:</p>

<p>This step is almost always initiated by Fridget, but could potentially be done by another class in the future.</p>

<p>Step 2 &amp; 3:</p>

<p>The parseSortTypeForList() method is called in Parser, with the currentUserInput as a parameter.
The parser returns a String as sortType with the detected sort type in the user input.</p>

<p>Step 4 &amp; 5:</p>

<p>The getIngredientList() method is called in IngredientList, with the sortType as a parameter.
The IngredientList returns an ArrayList<Ingredient> as listOfIngredients that are sorted according to the sort type.</Ingredient></p>

<p>Step 6 &amp; 7:</p>

<p>The printListMessage() method is called in Ui, with the listOfIngredient, and sortType as parameters.
The Ui prints out the list of Ingredients for the user.</p>

<p>Step 8:</p>

<p>The execution of the execute() method ends.</p>

<h3 id="finding-items-in-fridget">Finding Items In Fridget</h3>

<h3 id="listing-items-expiring-in-fridget">Listing Items Expiring In Fridget</h3>

<h3 id="configuring-notifications">Configuring Notifications</h3>

<h4 id="main-objectives-4">Main Objectives:</h4>

<p>The objective of the notification based on current functionality is to print out a reminder notification 
to remind users to eat healthily.</p>

<p>Current implementation allow users to toggle the notifications on or off, with reminders sent out at intervals of 6 hours.</p>

<p>The purpose of implementing time interval and ability to toggle is to prevent excessive notification printing.</p>

<p>Future uses include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Notification on expired and expiring items printed.</li>
  <li>Notification on items that are rarely used.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="sequence-of-execution-1">Sequence of execution:</h4>

<h3 id="exiting-from-fridget">Exiting From Fridget</h3>

<h2 id="product-scope">Product scope</h2>
<h3 id="target-user-profile">Target user profile</h3>

<p><b>Tech-savvy Families</b> who cook at home, buy groceries, and own a fridge</p>

<h3 id="value-proposition">Value proposition</h3>

<p>Nowadays, fridges are operated manually. Hence, users need to go through item by item manually to perform any function related to their fridge, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Figuring out what food is close to expiring</li>
  <li>Figuring out if they have enough ingredients for a certain recipe</li>
  <li>Figuring out if they are any recipes that they can make with their ingredients</li>
  <li>Adding/removing items into/from the fridge and storing it in a ledger</li>
  <li>Find out items that need to be bought soon</li>
</ul>

<p>This CLI based application hopes to automate a lot of the tasks users have relating to the fridge, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Automated reminder for items nearing expiry or items requiring replenishment</li>
  <li>Automated housekeeping: Storing items that are added/removed in a central ledger</li>
  <li>Automated shopping list: Listing out missing ingredients for meals that users want to cook</li>
</ul>
